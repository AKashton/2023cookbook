            <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian layered dessert with rum-flavored, coffee-soaked ladyfingers, a creamy
                mascarpone custard, and whipped cream. This tiramisu recipe is easy to make at home for an impressive
                no-bake dessert.</p>
            <p>Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe calls for a
                mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave it out. It will still be
                delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee is extra strong). </p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Egg Yolks:</strong> – Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth
                    filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of
                    food-borne illness.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> – White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to
                    create a sweet, creamy filling.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Milk:</strong> – Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable
                    texture.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cream:</strong> – Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped
                    cream.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> – Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mascarpone:</strong> – Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh
                    taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> – Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives
                    tiramisu its signature flavor.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rum:</strong> – Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers.
                    Some Allrecipes community members say they prefer Kahlua.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Ladyfingers:</strong> – Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick
                    fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into
                    strips.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong> – Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa
                    powder.
            </ul>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <aside>
                <h4>How to Store Tiramisu</h4>
                <p>Tiramisu is served chilled, so refrigerate the dessert (as well as any leftovers) immediately. Store
                    in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. </p>
                <h4>Can You Freeze Tiramisu? </h4>
                <p>Yes, you can absolutely freeze tiramisu. Wrap the tiramisu in a layer of plastic wrap and then a
                    layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. </p>
